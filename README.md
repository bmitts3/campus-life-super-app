This project is a Campus Super App that has dining hall, event, and gpa information. This site's primary purpose is to provide campus information. 
This site uses HTML, CSS, JS. It has API integration, JS interactivity, and bootstrap implementation.
Deploy using github pages.
The website has a navigation bar to move from page to page with clickable buttons. The GPA Calculator allows you to calculate your semester gpa. In order to calculate you just need to add rows for the amount of classes you have and input your grade and credits. 
The biggest improvement would be able to create an events page that updates automatically and also allows people to input the events into their calendar. One other improvement would be to create a campus chat forum.
